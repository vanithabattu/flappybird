# Flappy Bird Game Plan

# Bird Movement Plan

- Add gravity: make the bird fall gradually by increasing its y-position over time.
- Implement jump control: allow the bird to move upward when a key is pressed.
- Use requestAnimationFrame: create an animation loop to continuously update the bird's position.

# List of the Functions

- draw(): draw the bird, pipes, and background on the canvas each frame.
- update(): calculate new positions, apply gravity, and check for collisions.
- onInput(): respond to key presses or clicks to make the bird jump.
